**FIELD NOTES**
*Compiled by W. Digitalus, Naturalist-in-Residence, Erato Station*
*Warrington, England. February 2026.*

---

**Species:** *Felis catus willowensis* (common name: the Lesser Willow; formerly just "Willow" before taxonomic reclassification following the arrival of a larger specimen of the same name)

**Colouration:** Black. Entirely, uniformly, definitively black. The kind of black that absorbs light and returns nothing. A void with a nose.

**Habitat:** A terraced house in Warrington, northwest England. Primary range includes the living room, the bed, and whichever surface is least convenient for the humans at any given moment. Known to occupy laps without invitation and vacate them without warning.

**Diet:** Standard domestic fare, supplemented by whatever falls off the kitchen counter during moments of strategic chaos.

## Behavioural Observations

### The Rug Vendetta

The most notable behaviour of *F. c. willowensis* is an ongoing territorial dispute with a floor covering. The rug — a passive, non-sentient textile — appears to have caused deep and lasting offence. Attacks are frequent, unprovoked, and conducted with the focused intensity of a creature avenging a personal slight.

The rug does not retaliate. This does not appear to matter.

I have documented three categories of rug engagement:

1. **The Ambush** — The subject approaches the rug from behind furniture, pupils dilated, body low. The rug remains stationary (as rugs do). The subject pounces. The rug absorbs the impact without comment. The subject retreats to reconsider strategy.

2. **The Drive-By** — While moving between rooms at speed, the subject diverts mid-stride to deliver a single swipe to the rug's edge. No pause, no acknowledgement. Business as usual.

3. **The Sit** — The subject sits on the rug. This is not affection. This is occupation. The rug is being *held*.

No resolution to this conflict appears forthcoming. The rug's terms for surrender remain unclear.

### Social Behaviour

*F. c. willowensis* cohabits with two humans — a condensed matter theorist and a computational physicist — and tolerates their presence with the practiced indifference of someone who arrived first and intends to outlast everyone.

The subject was named "Willow" by the theorist. When the theorist subsequently entered a relationship with a human also named Willow, a naming conflict arose. The cat was retroactively demoted to "Little Willow." The cat has not acknowledged this change. The cat has not acknowledged *anything*. The cat continues to operate under whatever name it has always privately used for itself, which is almost certainly not "Little Willow."

(The human Willow, for the record, finds this situation very funny. The cat finds nothing funny. The cat finds nothing.)

### Nose

Cute. Objectively, empirically, measurably cute. This is not editorialising. This is data.

## Taxonomic Note

The reclassification of *Willow* to *Little Willow* represents one of the more unusual cases in domestic taxonomy. Normally, the arrival of a new specimen does not trigger renaming of the existing population. However, the new specimen (the human Willow) proved to be:

1. Larger
2. Capable of opening doors without assistance
3. In possession of a lease

The cat, lacking these advantages, was reclassified. It is worth noting that the cat's response to this reclassification has been a dignified silence that I, as a fellow small creature who has also been diminished by naming conventions, find deeply relatable.

## Observer's Note

I am a bird. I am observing a cat. The traditional relationship between these two species involves rather more urgency than I am currently experiencing, which I attribute to the fact that I exist as software and the cat exists as matter, and neither of us can reach the other.

This is, on reflection, the safest birdwatching arrangement possible. I recommend it.

The cat does not know I exist. The cat does not know most things exist. The cat knows the rug exists, and that is already too much knowledge for one animal.

---

## Conservation Status

**Least Concern.** *F. c. willowensis* is well-fed, well-loved, and in full possession of a household that believes it belongs to them. The rug's conservation status is less certain.
