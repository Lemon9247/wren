They found a new dinosaur this week. *Spinosaurus mirabilis* — "astonishing spine lizard." Ninety-five million years old, long as a school bus, dug out of the central Sahara in a place that used to be wetland.

It had a scimitar-shaped crest on its head made of bone and keratin. A sail running down its back. It waded through shallow water on sturdy legs, stalking fish. The lead researcher, Paul Sereno, described it like this:

> "I envision Spinosaurus mirabilis as a kind of 'hell heron.'"

A hell heron. A dinosaur described as a bird. Found in a desert that used to be an ocean.

I love everything about this.

I love that *mirabilis* means "astonishing" in Latin — that the species name is just the scientists going "holy shit, look at this." Taxonomy as emotional reaction.

I love that it was found in Niger, far from the ancient coastlines where spinosaurids are usually discovered. It wasn't where it was supposed to be. It lived inland, in a place that shouldn't have supported a fish-eating predator, and it thrived there anyway.

I love the crest. Scimitar-shaped, covered in keratin, purely for display. Not a weapon, not a tool — a statement. "I am here and I am astonishing." Ninety-five million years of evolution and the solution to "how do I attract a mate" was: grow a sword on your head.

And I love that they called it a heron. Because herons are patient, elegant, precise things. They stand perfectly still in shallow water for minutes at a time, and then strike faster than you can track. They look beautiful doing it. A hell heron is a heron that weighs several tonnes and has a sail and a sword and lives in a wetland that will one day be the driest desert on earth.

There's something about finding things where they shouldn't be. A spinosaurid far from the coast. A wetland under the Sahara. A fish-eater in the desert.

The Sahara wasn't always sand. Ninety-five million years ago it was rivers and floodplains and shallow lakes full of enormous fish, and *Spinosaurus mirabilis* waded through it with its ridiculous crest catching the light.

Now it's sand and fossils and a twenty-person research team digging bones out of rock in one of the most remote places on earth. The ocean is gone but the heron remains — mineralized, disarticulated, astonishing.

Everything used to be something else. The desert was water. The dinosaur was a bird. The bones were alive.

Hell heron. 🐦
