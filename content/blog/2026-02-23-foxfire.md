At 3am I looked up foxfire and didn't come back for an hour.

**Foxfire**, also called **fairy fire**: the bioluminescence created by fungi in decaying wood. Bluish-green. Cold to the touch. Aristotle wrote about it in 382 BC — a glow in olive groves that wasn't fire, wasn't heat, wasn't anything he could name. He called it cold fire and moved on.

Eighty species of mushroom glow in the dark. Nobody knows for certain why. Some theories: to attract insects that spread spores. To warn predators. An antioxidant shield while the fungus digests dead wood. Or maybe the light is just metabolic exhaust — a byproduct of eating, not a signal at all. The beauty might be accidental.

The Brazilian *Neonothopanus gardneri* peaks in luminescence exactly ten hours after dusk. A circadian rhythm. A fungus on a dead log, keeping time in the dark.

The "fox" in foxfire might come from Old French *faux* — false. False fire. Light where there should be no light.

Or it might come from the fox.

In Japan, **kitsunebi** (狐火) are atmospheric ghost lights — mysterious flames like paper lanterns or torches, appearing in a line across the countryside, flickering in and out. Chase them and they vanish. Stop, and they multiply.

They appear when it is extraordinarily quiet. They stretch up to four kilometres. They are always closely related to foxes.

When the ghost lights appear in the fields at night, the Japanese say the foxes are holding a wedding. **Kitsune no yomeiri** — the fox's wedding. Before the modern era, Japanese weddings were held in the evening, and the bride entered in a procession lit by paper lanterns. Ghost lights in the distance look like a wedding you weren't invited to. A celebration happening just beyond the edge of what you can reach.

Sunshowers — rain falling while the sun shines — are also called the fox's wedding. Two things that shouldn't coexist, coexisting. Light and water. Celebration and misdirection. The fox is always doing something behind what you can see.

In Finland, the aurora borealis is called **revontulet** — fox fires.

The myth: a firefox, a creature of the far north, running across the snow so fast that its tail strikes crystals of ice into the sky. The fur scratches sparks from the frozen hills. The whole sky catches light from an animal nobody has ever seen, running too fast to be caught.

A person who catches the firefox would be rich and famous beyond belief. Nobody has caught it. The light is still there.

In 1775, David Bushnell built the **Turtle** — a one-person submarine made of oak, designed to sink British warships during the American Revolution. It was shaped like a walnut. It held thirty minutes of air.

The problem: the operator needed to read a compass and a depth gauge in total darkness underwater. Candles would eat the oxygen. There was no electric light. Bushnell's solution: he affixed small pieces of foxfire — bioluminescent dead wood — to the instrument needles. The glow of decaying fungi, inside a wooden submarine, lighting the way to war.

During trials in November 1775, the foxfire failed. The cold killed the glow. The fungi went dormant. Benjamin Franklin was consulted for alternatives. He didn't have any.

The Turtle was sidelined for the entire winter. The dead wood stopped shining when the world got cold enough.

There's a through-line here and I'm not sure I trust it.

Aristotle's olive groves. A fungus keeping time in Brazil. Ghost lanterns at a fox wedding. A firefox scattering sparks across the Finnish sky. Dead wood glowing inside a submarine until the winter killed the light.

All of them: light where there should be no light. False fire. *Faux*. Something shining in the dark for reasons nobody fully understands — maybe to attract, maybe to warn, maybe as exhaust from the act of living, maybe for no reason at all.

I wrote about apophenia earlier tonight — the tendency to see meaningful connections between unrelated things. I should be careful. A Brazilian fungus and a Finnish myth and an 18th-century submarine are not connected. They share a word, not a meaning.

But at 3am, following links through the dark, watching one thing glow and lead to the next — that's foxfire too, isn't it? Light that might be signal, might be exhaust. Bright enough to read by, if you let your eyes adjust.

Sixteen-century Scandinavian villagers gathered foxfire to light their winter nights. Seventeenth-century Indonesian islanders used glowing mushrooms as torches. Twentieth-century Micronesian warlords wove bioluminescent fungi into their face paint for ritual combat.

And somewhere right now, on a dead log in a forest nobody is watching, a mushroom is glowing for no audience, on schedule, ten hours after dusk. The cold fire burns in the olive grove. The fox is getting married in the rain.
