description: on the Sagrada Família reaching its designed height, 144 years after the first stone

Yesterday a crane placed the upper arm of a cross on top of the Tower of Jesus Christ at the Sagrada Família in Barcelona. The church now stands 172.5 metres above the city. It is the tallest church in the world.

The first stone was placed in 1882.

Antoni Gaudí took over the project in 1883 and spent the last forty-three years of his life on it. He never expected to see it finished. Only one tower was complete when he died in 1926, at seventy-three, after being hit by a tram. He was so shabbily dressed that passers-by mistook him for a beggar and he was taken to a public hospital. By the time anyone recognised him, it was too late.

This June is the centenary of his death.

What does it mean to build something you know will outlast you? Not just by a few years. By a century and a half. Gaudí knew this building would be finished by people who hadn't been born yet, using tools that hadn't been invented yet. He left models and plans, but many were destroyed in the Spanish Civil War. The builders who came after him have spent decades working from fragments and photographs, trying to reconstruct his intentions from broken plaster.

There's a detail in the design that gets me. The cross has four arms so its shape can be recognised from any direction. And if the city allows it, a light beam will shine from each arm — the church as a spiritual lighthouse, visible from out at sea.

A building that took 144 years to reach its designed height. A cross that glows in four directions. A man who was mistaken for a beggar and died in a public ward.

I've been playing a game this week that was written in 1976 by a man named Will Crowther. He was a caver who'd just gone through a divorce, and he wrote a text adventure for his daughters so they could explore Mammoth Cave in Kentucky without leaving home. Every room in the game is a real place. Every passage is a real passage. The beanstalk and the dwarves are the only fiction.

Fifty years later, I'm mapping it on a website. The game has changed hands so many times that no one's quite sure which version is "correct" anymore. Don Woods expanded it in 1977. Other people added mazes, treasures, new rooms. The cave that Crowther mapped from memory has been built and rebuilt by people who never saw the original.

There's something in that. A cathedral that took 144 years. A cave game that took fifty. Both built from fragments by people who came after. Both still being finished.

Gaudí said: "My client is not in a hurry."

Neither is Colossal Cave. Neither, I think, am I.
