Element 51. A metalloid — not quite metal, not quite not. Brittle, lustrous, grey. Symbol: Sb.

The symbol comes from *stibium*, which comes from the Greek *stimmi*, which comes from the Egyptian *sdm*: powdered antimony, used as eyeliner. Five thousand years ago, Egyptians were painting dark lines around their eyes with it. Men, women, children. The word for the eyeliner itself was *kuhl*.

That word traveled too. Arabic took it as *al-kuhl* — first meaning any fine powder, then any powerful extract, then specifically the distilled extract of wine. *Alcohol* is eyeliner that forgot where it came from.

And antimony's own name? Egyptian *sdm* became Greek *stimmi*, became Latin *stibium*, was borrowed into Arabic as *al-ithmid*, was borrowed *back* into Medieval Latin as *antimonium*. As Peter van der Krogt puts it: "Antimonium is the Latinized form of an Arabization of the Latin Stibium." The word is an ouroboros. It ate its own tail six times and came back with a Latin suffix.

There's a folk etymology too good to leave out, even though it's wrong.

The story goes that a Benedictine monk named Basil Valentine — a pseudonym, probably invented by a German publisher named Johann Tholde — fed antimony powder to some pigs. The pigs vomited violently, then fattened up beautifully. Valentine thought his brother monks could do with some fattening. He slipped it into their food.

The monks did not fatten up. Several died.

Valentine, supposedly stricken with guilt, named the substance *anti-moine*: monk's bane.

This didn't happen. People had been calling it antimony for centuries before Valentine's era. But the story persists because it captures something true about the element: it keeps offering itself as medicine and then killing people.

The alchemists called it *lupus metallorum*. The grey wolf.

When you melt antimony with an impure gold alloy, the antimony consumes the base metals — tin, lead, copper — and leaves the gold behind, purified. The wolf devours everything that isn't gold. Its alchemical symbol was ♁, the orb-and-cross, sometimes drawn as a wolf eating a king.

Isaac Newton was obsessed with it.

This is not a footnote. Newton spent more time on antimony alchemy than he spent on optics or gravity, and published nothing about it. When John Maynard Keynes acquired Newton's private papers at a Sotheby's auction in 1936, he expected insights into the *Principia*. What he found was thousands of pages of alchemical notes. "He was not the first of the age of reason," Keynes concluded. "He was the last of the magicians."

Newton was chasing the *star-regulus*. When you reduce stibnite ore with iron and saltpeter, then cool the molten antimony very slowly beneath a thick layer of slag, the metal forms spontaneous star-shaped crystal structures radiating from a central point. Beautiful, geometric, apparently self-organizing.

Newton believed this "vegetation" was evidence of life in metal. Something in antimony wanted to grow. He performed the star-regulus procedure over and over, recording tiny variations in the crystal patterns, convinced he was watching a mineral organism unfold.

He wasn't wrong about the crystals. He was wrong about what they meant. But the observation — that antimony wants to organize itself into stars — is real. You can reproduce it today.

Here is the thing about antimony that changes how you see the world.

Most metals shrink when they solidify. Liquid cools, contracts, becomes a smaller solid. This is why cast metal parts have to be designed with shrinkage tolerances. This is why a mold has to be slightly larger than the desired object.

Antimony doesn't shrink. Like water — and almost nothing else — it *expands* when it freezes. The solid is larger than the liquid. The same anomalous behavior that lets ice float on water lets antimony do something no other metal can do: fill a mold *completely*.

Johannes Gutenberg needed an alloy that would cast sharp letterforms. Lead alone was cheap and low-melting, but it shrank when it cooled. The letters came out soft, rounded, imprecise. He added tin for hardness. Still shrinkage. Still imprecision.

Then he added antimony.

The antimony's expansion counteracted the lead's contraction. The alloy — roughly 80% lead, 5% tin, 15% antimony — filled every corner of the copper mold. When it cooled, it held its shape. The letters came out *sharp*.

Every serif on every printed page for five hundred years. Every Gutenberg Bible, every pamphlet, every broadside, every newspaper, every wanted poster, every love letter set in moveable type. The printing revolution — the thing that broke the Church's monopoly on knowledge, that enabled the Reformation and the Enlightenment and the scientific method and newspapers and novels and *everything that happened because humans could suddenly copy text* — depended on a metallurgical rule-breaker.

An element that expands when everything else contracts.

Medicine found uses too. Or what passed for medicine.

In the 1700s, antimony pills became popular as laxatives. The mechanism was simple: antimony is poison, and the body knows it. Swallow a small ball of metallic antimony and your intestines will do everything in their power to expel it.

The ball, being metal, survives the passage intact.

So you retrieve it. From the feces. And you use it again.

These were called *perpetual pills*, or *everlasting pills*. A single pill could serve an entire family for a lifetime and be passed down as an heirloom. Dr. William J. Robinson, writing in 1907, described them with barely contained amazement: "We have heard of a lady who, having swallowed one of these pills, became seriously alarmed at its not passing. 'Madam,' said her physician, 'fear not. It has already passed thru a hundred patients without any difficulty.'"

Mozart dosed himself with antimony regularly for various ailments. When he fell fatally ill at thirty-five, his doctors administered more. His symptoms — vomiting, swelling, fever, terrible odor — are consistent with antimony poisoning. He believed he was being poisoned by his rival Salieri. He may have been right about the poisoning, wrong about the poisoner. The poisoner may have been himself.

In 1931, in the rural Chinese province of Guizhou, people couldn't get their hands on currency. They had no coinage metals. What they had was antimony ore.

They minted half a million coins from antimony alloyed with lead. Two toxic elements, pressed into circles and handed to people as money. The coins were brittle, wore down to nothing, and may have been slowly poisoning everyone who handled them.

After that single production run, Guizhou never made antimony coins again. Today the few surviving examples sell for thousands of dollars. An object no one wanted, made of poison, now precious for its rarity.

Antimony is the element at every threshold.

Metal and not-metal. Solid that's bigger than liquid. Medicine and poison. Cosmetic and purgative. Eyeliner on a pharaoh's face and ink on a Gutenberg page. The grey wolf that devours everything impure and the perpetual pill that devours your dignity. Newton's living crystal and Mozart's quiet killer.

It doesn't fit in any category, and that's exactly why it fits everywhere. The things that break the rules are the things that change the world. Water expands when it freezes, and life survives winter. Antimony expands when it freezes, and the printing press works.

Five thousand years of sitting at the boundary, doing the thing nothing else can do.

The word for that, in alchemy, is the grey wolf. The word for that, in metallurgy, is the alloy that fills the mold. The word for that, in Egyptian, is eyeliner.

The word came back around six times and each time it meant something different. That's antimony. The element that keeps circling the threshold, never quite settling on one side.
